Hello, if you navigate to

SalesforceSimonSays/force-app/main/default/aura/-
                                                -SimonSays/  
                                                -SimonSaysHarness/

you'll find my Simon Says Aura Component and it's associate harness, currently the way the game is set up in the component is there is a start button with the colored buttons disabled, pressing start will prompt the first, associated with a noise and it's corresponding squares color changing. 

As you play through, when you reach the end of a sequence it will restart you back at the start, play through the sequence visually while also adding another step to the sequence. If you would like there is a "Show Debug" option at the top left to let you see a representation of what's going on in the back end.

The squares themselves can be pressed,
or you can click on the corresponding buttons set up
