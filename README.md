                                                -SimonSays/  
                                                -SimonSaysHarness/

you'll find my Simon Says Aura Component and it's associate harness, currently the way the game is set up in the component is there is a start button with the colored buttons disabled, pressing start will prompt the first, associated with a noise and it's corresponding squares color changing

The squares themselves can be pressed,
or you can click on the corresponding buttons set up
