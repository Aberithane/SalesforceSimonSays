                                                -SimonSays/  
                                                -SimonSaysHarness/

you'll find my Simon Says Aura Component and it's associate harness, currently the way the game is set up in the component is there is a start button with the colored buttons disabled, pressing start will prompt the first color via an alert, pressing start again will reset the game and prompt the first color via an alert. When you complete a sequence there will be an alert informing you, and it will then present the sequence again, via an alert featuring that steps color per step in the sequence. This doesn't reflect the game device Simon as it is reliant on pop ups which do not time out and are dismissed manually, so it does not feature the same set up as a true Simon game, as that has a constant timing for each step causing the sequences to be a bit harder to remember, at least that's how I feel about it.
